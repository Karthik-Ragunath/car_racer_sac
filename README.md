# RL_driving
Autonomous driving with deep reinforcement learning.  

## To-Dos
* Retrain convolutional autoencoder (Timo)
* Implement Variational Autoencoder (Timo)
* Train TD3 (Timo)
* Understand SAC (Marius & Joan)
* Prepare algorithm code of choice for implementation (Marius & Joan)


## Questions
