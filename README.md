# RL_driving
Autonomous driving with deep reinforcement learning.  

## To-Dos
* Generate Training data for autoencoder (Timo)
* Train autoencoder (Timo)
* Understand SAC (Marius & Joan)
* Prepare algorithm code of choice for implementation (Marius & Joan)


## Questions
* Can we improve autoencoder results with ResBlocks?
* Can we improve autoencoder results with pretrained ResNet (probably ResNet 18)?
* Compare latent representations of AE vs VAE
